# sky-monitor ### Graduation design 2016


##### Abstract:
All of us have the experience looking upon the sky and appreciating the marvel of cosmos, but most of us rarely have opportunity watching those constellations closely via a professional astronomical telescope. Designing and realizing a platform to deliver information and data that come from astronomical observation equipment would allow its users to get access to an astronomical observation equipment and observe the marvelous cosmos real-time, and what they need is only a cell phone.
	This paper study how to design and realize the server and client program, the major tasks include preparing the astronomical telescope, acquiring data resources from astronomy equipment by using JMF on the computer, creating Socket connections with android devices that ask for access, delivering media data from the captured astronomy equipment to the android device, watching the real-time observation video on the client, asking for a high-pixel photo from server.

##### 摘要
我们都曾有仰望星空的经历，但真正通过天文观测设备亲自去观测宇宙，对大多数人来说都是可望而不可即的事情。设计并实现天文观测设备的信息数据发布系统，使得用户只需要一台联网的手机，就可以远程访问天文观测设备，实时观测壮阔的宇宙。
论文研究如何设计与实现服务器与客户端程序，主要模块包括天文望远镜的准备工作、通过电脑获取天文望远镜资源、借助Java媒体框架JMF获取天文观测设备的数据源、通过建立socket连接向请求访问的android设备进行图像数据的分发、利用多线程实现多用户同时访问、客户端观看天文观测设备的实时观测视频、客户端向服务器请求高清图片进行查看、保存与分享。
